This is the C2-Ray code for time-dependent photo-ionization calculations.
This version is for 3D, multiple sources, and for hydrogen only.
It runs under both MPI and OpenMP.

The factorization branch is a new version which tries to reduce the
length of subroutines to make the code more manageable and easier
to read. This branch has now passed a range of tests and will be
the one in which future developments will take place.
