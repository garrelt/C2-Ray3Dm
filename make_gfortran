# Makefile for C2Ray_3D.
#
# Author: Garrelt Mellema

# This Makefile can make different versions of C2Ray_3D.
# These versions differ in their parallelization and/or
# in their connection to specific N-body results.
# It uses the GNU compiler. Please use one of the other
# makefiles to compile with another compiler.
#
# Note 1: Parallelization
# The parallelization intended is specified in the name
# of the executable: _omp means OpenMP (shared memory), 
# _mpi means MPI (distributed memory). Both can also be
# used at the same time (if your architecture supports
# it.
#
# Note 2: N-body module
# Different versions exist with different Nbody interfaces:
# pmfast - interface to older pmfast simulations
# cubep3m - interface to cubep3m simulations
# LG - interface to Local Group simulations (GADGET)
# Gadget - interface to LOFAR EoR GADGET simulations (not working)
#
# Note 3: Compiler & Flags
# The compiler is specified by the FC variable (MPIFC for the MPI
# compiler). We have only extensively used the Intel F90 compiler. 
# Support for other compilers will have to be added.
# Parts of the code need to know about the compiler, this is
# done through preprocessor statements. So when compiling with
# intel compiler, -DIFORT needs to be specified. Support for
# new compilers thus needs to be added in the code too.
#
# Note 4: Recompiling
# Some dependencies are through module parameters, and thus
# not recognized by make. Best practise is to run "make clean"
# before running "make".

# These flags should be added to the F90FLAGS1 depending on the executable
# made. Specify this below on a per executable basis.
MPI_FLAGS = -DMPI # 
#MPI_FLAGS = -DMPI -DMPILOG # Add more (MPI node) diagnostic output
